# Public Restrooms Map — San Diego

An interactive, public-facing map that displays restroom locations in San Diego and allows community members to **suggest new locations or updates**. All submissions are **reviewed before appearing on the map**.

This project is designed to be:
- Public and accessible
- Low-cost and maintainable
- Transparent and auditable
- Friendly to non-technical reviewers

---

## What this project does

- Displays a **baseline dataset** of public restrooms on an interactive map
- Allows the public to:
  - Suggest a **new restroom location**
  - Suggest a **change to an existing restroom**
- Collects submissions through a custom web form
- Stores submissions in Google Sheets
- Shows **only approved submissions** on the public map

The map and form are hosted as a **static website** using GitHub Pages.

### Key principles
- Baseline data is **never overwritten**
- All public input is **append-only**
- Updates are merged using a stable internal ID (`GlobalID`)
- Approval is required before changes appear publicly

## How the contribution process works

This project uses a **reviewed contribution model**. Public users can suggest information, but no changes appear on the map until they are reviewed and approved.

### Step 1: A user makes a suggestion
A visitor to the map can:
- Click **anywhere on the map** to suggest a new restroom location, or
- Click an **existing restroom marker** to suggest a change (for example: hours, accessibility, or status)

The user fills out a short form directly on the site and submits their suggestion.

### Step 2: The suggestion is recorded (but not public yet)
When a suggestion is submitted:
- It is sent to a Google Sheet via a secure endpoint
- Each submission is saved as a **new row**
- Submissions are marked `approved = FALSE` by default

At this stage:
- Nothing on the public map changes
- The baseline dataset remains untouched
- A complete submission history is preserved

---

### Step 3: Review and approval
Project maintainers periodically review new submissions in the Google Sheet.

For each submission, maintainers may:
- Verify the information
- Compare it with the baseline data
- Add review notes (optional)
- Approve or reject the submission

To approve a submission, the maintainer sets:
